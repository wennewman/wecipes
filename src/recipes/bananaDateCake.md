###Ingredients

3 egg whites  
125g butter  
1tbs golden syrup  
½ cup brown or raw sugar  
1 mashed banana  
½ cup chopped dates  
1 cup SR flour  
½ cup almond meal  
1 tsp vanilla essence  
½ tsp bi carb soda  
¼ cup water  

###Method

1. Set oven to 180ºc
2. Grease and line largish high sided cake tin
3. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks
4. Put the chopped dates and golden syrup into microwave dish and cover with water.  Microwave for approximately 3 minutes or until dates turn to soft mush when mashed with a fork
5. In separate bowl, beat butter, sugar and vanilla until creamy
6. While the dates are hot, add the soda and stir so it floofts up, then stir in the mashed banana and almond meal(this cools the mix too so you don't scramble the eggs)
7. Fold the date mixture through the creamed butter and sugar
8. Fold in flour and then egg whites
9. Bake in oven for approximately 50 minutes.  You should smell the cake once it is cooked - when pierced with a knife, the knife should come out clean
