description: "I'm pretty excited about this now as I have refined the base flavour and it sets to jelly. It can be used for all kinds of good; I have it in the fridge always and it keeps for up to 3 weeks.  I'm not sure what science and food regulations would say about that but I'm here to tell the tale"

I use a pressure cooker for making stock; it only takes an hour once it is up to pressure. Alternatively you can keep a slow rolling simmer in a large stock pot for 2-4 hours.  NOTE: The more chopped surface area on the veggies,the more veggie flavour can get out.  I used to just cut them all in half but learned at culinary school to chop them up.  There is definitely a benefit to cutting them up, but versus bought chicken stock, it is still infinitely better.  

##Ingredients  
2kg chicken bones (I frames, wings or necks - whatever I find on special.  You can also use a whole chook)  
2 large carrots, washed and chopped  
2 large onions, peeled and chopped roughly  
4 sticks of celery roughly chopped  
3 garlic cloves  
1 tbsp black peppercorns  
1 tbsp salt  
3 bay leaves  
2 sprigs of thyme  
bunch of parsley - curly or flat  
6 litres cold water

**Optional items:**  
Parmesan cheese rind (I throw these in the freezer once I finish the cheese block to use for stock)  
1 punnet of mushrooms, skins wiped  
1 leek, roots removed and well washed, chopped the size of onions and carrots  
1 tomato  
1 slice of lemon rind  

###Method

1. Place the chicken into a large (10l) stock pot.  Add the water and bring to boil.
2. Simmer on high for about 10 minutes (no more than that) and continue to skim the dirty foam from the top.
3. Meanwhile, grab a couple of big steel cooking bowls to help with prep - one for the chopped veggies; one for the veggie scraps.
4. Chop the veggies into approx 2-4cm pieces.
5. Remove any more scum from the top of the water and reduce the heat to a very slow rolling simmer.
6. Add the veggies, herbs and seasoning.
7. Did I mention a slow rolling simmer?  Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-4 hours.
8. Strain and bottle while still boiling hot.  I turn the bottles up side down straight away to sterilise the lids. 

Will keep up to 2 weeks at below 4C degrees.  Once cooled you can store in the freezer for 3-6 months.  This is really worth the effort and makes a huge difference to your home cooked food.  Also delicious heated with a spoon of miso.
