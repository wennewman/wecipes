description: "These are mum's chocolate forcer biscuits.  She made them only occasionally as a treat and we totally devoured them.  My forcer bugged out mid verification testing, so I made a sausage out of the rest of the mix and sliced them up with a really thin blade.  This has been updated on the date above as the cup measures are ambiguous.  Mum used to use an old style tea cup so I tried with this today.  They turned out much better, so an update August 2021 removing the ambiguity in quantity... you know baking and science n stuff?"
