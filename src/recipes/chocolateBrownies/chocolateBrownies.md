###Ingredients
185g dark chocolate  
185g butter  
50g white chocolate bits or chopped chocolate  
50g milk chocolate bits or chopped chocolate  
275g castor sugar  
3 eggs  
85g flour  
40g cocoa  
1 tsp vanilla essence  
1 shot of espresso

###Method

1. Set oven at 160ºc fan or 180ºc normal oven
2. Grease and line lamington or brownie pan
3. Put sugar, vanilla and eggs into mixer and beat on high for 8 minutes until thick and leaves a trail
4. While the eggs are beating, melt butter and dark chocolate in microwave. Mix together so it is combined and shiny. Add the shot of coffee and leave to cool while the eggs are beating
5. Carefully fold the cooled chocolate into the beaten egg mixture
6. Add the sifted flour and cocoa and fold through until combined
7. Stir through the choc bits (or chopped chocolate)
8. Bake for 30 - 35 minutes or until just set. Leave to cool in pan
9. Refrigerate; will keep for two weeks (I doubt it very much)
