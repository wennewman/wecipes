Classic recipe from childhood. Set the oven to moderate 180ºc and line a baking sheet with baking paper before you start. NOTE: this is an old family recipe, so the cup measures used are an old tea cup (rather than an Aus 250ml measuring cup)

## Ingredients

¼ lb butter  
½ cup sugar  
1 egg  
1 cup SR flour  
1 tsp vanilla essence  
2 cups cornflakes  
3/4 cup sultanas

## Method

1. Cream butter and sugar in bowl with electric mixer
2. Add egg and vanilla and beat until smooth
3. Mix through sultanas and then flour
4. Roll into balls then roll in cornflakes
5. Keep an eye on them after about 15 minutes; you may need to turn the tray mid bake so the cornflakes don't over brown
