You can cook this in a pan on the cook top or bake in the oven.  You could even do in the pressure cooker - probably take about 10 minutes once it is up to pressure (I've not tried that yet)

###Ingredients
2 tomatoes  
1 red onion  
1 garlic clove  
2 tbsp olive oil  
1kg chicken pieces with skin on  
1 cup rice  
2 cups of any stock (or water and a stock cube)  
2 carrots, finely chopped  
1 cup frozen peas  
1 green pepper, finely chopped  
1 corn cob with the kernels sliced off (or small tin of drained corn)  
1 tsp salt  
1 tsp ground pepper - black or white is good

###Method
1. Turn on the oven to 180Âºc
2. Blend the tomato, garlic and onion in a food processor or blender
3. Heat the oil in large oven proof pan; you don't want it too hot.
4. Brown the chicken pieces - 2-3 minutes should do it.
5. Take them out and put on a plate for now
6. Add rice to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring and coating with the chicken juice and residual oil in the pan; the rice will go a little brown which is what you want.
7. Pour in onion and tomato puree and cook for 2-3 minutes until the juice is cooked out a little
8. Stir in stock and veggies and bring to the boil. 
9. Place the chicken pieces back in - nesting them down into the rice
10. Put the lid on the pan and bake for 25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through
