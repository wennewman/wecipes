###Ingredients
200g Italian OO flour  
220g full fat ricotta cheese  
3 egg yolks  
30g grated parmesan  
Fresh grated nutmeg  
Salt and pepper

###Method
1. In a large bowl, mix the flour, ricotta, egg yolks, Parmesan, nutmeg and a pinch of salt and pepper together to form a soft, moist dough
2. Place on a floured work surface and knead for 3â€“5 minutes 
3. With your hands, roll the dough into a long, thin sausage shape and then cut it at right angles into rectangular shapes about 2cm long 
4. Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil and add the dumplings. Wait until they rise to the surface again, then lower the heat and simmer for a further 2 minutes 
5. Drain the dumplings with a slotted spoon and add to your fav pasta sauce; don't worry if there is some pasta water coming along for the ride 
6. Serve immediately with buckets of grated parmesan and some fresh basil.
