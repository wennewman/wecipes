###Ingredients
4 small eggs at room temperature  
3/4 cup castor sugar  
½ cup cornflour  
1 tbsp flour  
1 tsp cocoa  
1 tsp ground ginger  
1 tsp cream of tartar  
½ tsp bi-carb soda  
½ tbsp warmed golden syrup  

###Method
1. Beat eggs and sugar together until thick and creamy - about 10 minutes (I usually put the timer on to mitigate stronking and time voids)
2. While the eggs are beating, sift all of the dry ingredients together into a separate bowl and set aside.
3. Measure out the golden syrup into a microwave safe something, and warm for a couple of seconds in the microwave and set aside
4. Once the eggs and sugar are done, add the flour (I sift again into the eggs at this point) and the golden syrup
5. Carefully fold the flour and syrup through the egg mixture - do not beat or mix - gentle folding so you dont flatten the eggs
6. Pour into sponge tin - 2 sandwich tins or one bigger one (again I'm no sponge chef - I wing it each time - use what you know works
7. Bake in moderate oven for about 30 minutes but start checking about 25 minutes in.
8. For my twist at the end - hang the tin upside down until completely cooled
9. I fill with whipped cream with a hint of vanilla added and ice with some chocolate icing
