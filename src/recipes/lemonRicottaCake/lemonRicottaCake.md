description: "I totes made this up. Rad. If you dont have any almond meal, use all SR flour.  I make this sometimes with the leftover egg whites from the ricotta gnocchi but the recipe stands up fine without egg whites.  When you use a 375g ricotta tub for the gnocchi, this is just the leftovers."

###Ingredients
125g softened butter  
150g full fat ricotta cheese
1 cup sugar  
2 eggs  
Zest and juice of a lemon  
1 cup SR flour  
1/3 cup ground almonds  
3 egg whites (Optional)

###Method
1. Grease and line a deep loaf or cake tin.  
2. Set the oven to 180Âºc
3. If using, Beat egg whites until peaks form
4. In separate bowl, cream butter, ricotta and sugar with electric beater until pale and lighter in colour
5. Add the 2 eggs, one a time until mixed through
6. Fold through almond meal and lemon until combined
7. Fold through flour until just combined
8. If using egg whites, fold these through last
9. Bake in a moderate oven for approximately 45 minutes.  You will smell the cake once it is cooked; stab with a knife which should come out clean when cooked

_Note: If using the egg whites, you end up with a lighter spongy texture that could be sliced in half and filled with lemon curd and cream... just sayin_
