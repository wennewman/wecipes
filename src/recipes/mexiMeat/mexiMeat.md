###Ingredients
500g beef mince  
Â½ diced red pepper  
1 - 2 corn cobs (to your taste)  
2-3 chopped garlic cloves  
1 tbsp coriander seeds, toasted and ground (2 tsps if using ground)  
1 tbsp cumin seeds, toasted and ground (2 tsps if using ground)  
1 tsp fennel seeds, toasted and ground (1 tsp if using ground)  
1 tsp garlic powder  
1 tbsp smokey paprika  
1 tsp celery salt  
1 tsp onion powder  
t tsp salt  
1 tsp chilli flakes (or a chopped whole chilli)  
1 chopped onion  
1 tin of drained kidney beans (or a cup of your own home prepared beans  
2 tbsp tomato paste  
2 tbsps olive oil  
1 square of 70% (or higher) dark chocolate
###Method
1. Place the seeds in a dry pan and fry on medium heat for 2 minutes or until aromatic.  Pay attention as they can burn easily
2. Once smelling nice, put the seeds in your pestle and mortar or spice grinder and grind to powder; add some of the salt to help it along if you want.
3. Crush or finely chop garlic and chilli if using, and finely chop onion and set aside
4. Slice the corn off the cobs, chop the red pepper into corn cob sized cubes and set aside
5. In a large heavy based pan, add all of the dry spices and combine.  Make sure you mix the garlic powder in well before it gets too hot or it can clump together once it heats up
6. Add the oil and mix in the spices and then turn on the heat
7. Add onions, chilli, garlic, red pepper and corn and fry on medium heat until onions are transparent
8. Push the veggies to the edge of the pan and turn up the heat a little.  Add the mince and brown for 5 minutes
9. Mix the veggies back into the mince mixture and cook for another few minutes
10. Add the tomato paste, drained beans and a little water or stock if too dry
11. Cook for a few minutes and add the chocolate
The mix should be a little dry for tacos, tortillas or a mexi bowl
Serve with guac and salad, on a baked spud with cheese or whatever else floats your mexi boat
