description: "I generally wing it when making these.  Also not something I make very often but had a recipe request for a recent batch, so here tis.  Some like to add a tablespoon of relish to the meat mix; this adds some sweet.  Up to you.  Make them as big or small as you like"

###Ingredients
Home made rough puff or store bought puff pastry  
500g sausage mince  
500g lean beef mince  
2 large grated carrots  
1 large finely chopped onion  
¼ cup finely chopped fresh parsley  
1 tsp salt  
ground black pepper to your taste (I usually put almost 1 tbsp)  
1 tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp paprika  

###Method
1. Turn on your oven to 220ºc
2. Take the pastry sheets out of the freezer before you start if using frozen pastry
3. Combine all other ingredients in a large bowl (I usually use wet hands to do this)
4. Lay out your pastry and make about a 3cm sausage out of the meat mix and lay along the edge of the pastry.  I usually do one, then use it as a guide for the rest
5. Repeat until you have run out of meat and/or pastry (either leftover can go back in the freezer)
6. Before cutting them, brush with a lightly beaten egg or some milk.  You can sprinkle with sesame or nigella seeds if you like
7. Cut them to whatever size you like
8. Cooking time will vary depending the size you make them.  Start checking about 20 minutes in for a golden brown top and no juice running out of the middle of the meat
