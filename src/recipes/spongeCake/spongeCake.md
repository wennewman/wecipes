description: "This is a credit to Ral the sponge and scone queen; it's about 6 stories high if you have the skills... I do not hence the lack of photos.  I am still rubbish at sponges but it turns out I'm not a huge fan anyhoo.  I did learn in the test kitchen that the cooking time is important and it will sink in the centre if you overcook."

###Ingredients
4 eggs, separated  
pinch of salt  
3/4 cup castor sugar  
2 heaped tsp baking powder  
1 heaped cup cornflour

###Method

1. Set oven to 190Âºc
2. Beat egg whites and salt until stiff

5. Fold in sifted dry ingredients with a metal spoon
6. Divide evenly into two paper lined and greased, deep sponge tins (max 20 cm)
